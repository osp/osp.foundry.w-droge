  <body><h1>W drog&#281;</h1><p>We travelled to the Libre Graphics Meeting of Poland on a rented van. On the way, we photographed the Polish road signage.</p>
<p>In Wroc&#322;aw, we set out to produce a typeface based on these photos with a group of 20 courageous collaborators. We used Inkscape, Gimp and FontForge, and we were helped by open font community activists Dave Crossland, Alexandre Prokoudine and Nicolas Spalinger.</p>
<p>This is the outcome of the adventure. Three tactics were compared : by autotracing, by drawing the contour, and by geometricaly drawing centerline. Only one is published, guess which.</p>
<p>We have named it W Drog&#281; <em>On Our Way / En Route</em>.</p>
